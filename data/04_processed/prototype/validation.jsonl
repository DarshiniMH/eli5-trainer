{"input":"Molecular Geometry","output":"Molecular geometry is about the shape that a molecule makes when atoms join together. Imagine you have a central atom like a hub, and other atoms or groups are connected to it like spokes. The shape they form depends on how many atoms or groups are attached and how they arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This is because they repel each other, like how you might spread your arms and legs out if you were floating in water to keep balanced. Some common shapes are linear (like a straight line), bent (like a 'V'), and tetrahedral (like a pyramid with a triangle base). These shapes help determine how the molecule behaves and interacts with other molecules."}
{"input":"What is a gene pool?","output":"A gene pool is like a big collection of all the genes, or instructions, that are in a group of living things, like animals or plants, that can have babies together.
