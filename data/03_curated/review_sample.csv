Pending,Medicine,simple,How does the digestive system work?,"The digestive system is like a team in your body that helps turn the food you eat into energy and nutrients you need to grow and stay healthy. Here's how it works:

1. **Mouth**: It all starts when you chew your food. Your teeth break it into smaller pieces, and your saliva (spit) starts to break it down.

2. **Esophagus**: After you swallow, the food goes down a tube called the esophagus, which pushes it into your stomach.

3. **Stomach**: In your stomach, the food gets mixed with special juices that break it down even more into a mushy mix.

4. **Small Intestine**: This mushy mix moves into the small intestine, where tiny helpers called enzymes break it down even more. Your body absorbs the nutrients it needs here.

5. **Large Intestine**: What's left moves to the large intestine, where water is taken out, and the rest is turned into waste.

6. **Anus**: Finally, the waste leaves your body when you go to the bathroom.
